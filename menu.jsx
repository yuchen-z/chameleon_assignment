Thanks for your interest in a Frontend engineering role at Chameleon. We're a solid and collaborative team that
will always lend a helping hand. We prioritize asynchronousity in nearly all of our ways of working.

This exercise is meant to be a focused, high signal ~hour. Assume that if we've asked about it it's important to us.

Prompt:
  
  0. How are you today? ðŸ˜Š
  1. Below are the parts of basic selection menu, but there are issues and it's too specific for the single
     current use case. We all more or less agree it's not that great and needs some attention. It should be
     componentized/generalized so that other engineers on the team can use selection menus.
  2. Please consider this menu implemetation and following numbered items and to ask a discerning question back
     on the email thread that will help you mae a decision about which of two different options or paths to
     take (that you come up with) and we'll help you pick a path that will highlight your strengths.
  3. Now, make improvements to the menu; in the end it should meet the prompt and be able to be used in at least a
     couple different use cases such as an Account picker, a searchable list of items, one step of a flow
     to configure Alerting, etc...
  4. For certain use cases we would want to sync the menu selection to the server. We have an abstraction for syncing called
     httpPatch. It can be used like this => httpPatch('user', { [`menu-state-${key}`]: {true,false} }). Where would this
     be included and how/where best to handle this (properties needing to be synced/loaded to the backend)?
  5. Assuming others will use/add to this component in the future, write a 2-3 sentence "release note"
     to post into the #engineering channel in Slack (or add to the Components wiki page).

PS: No need to worry about CSS, actually making it "run" etc...

Now put youself in PR review mode...

  1. Please provide a couple Pull Request comments/suggestions to the engineer who wrote the code
     in pr-1.js; assume you're codeowner for the project on GitHub.
  2. Based on what you know from 1., how would you do this differently if you were
     to make this component from scratch?
